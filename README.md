## Project Description
In this project, I have developed a popular online memory game where the goal is to level up our memory.

**Game Rules -**
</br>
At the start of the game, we’ll have the *'bat-ball'* icon depicted on the cards, and a turn counter to keep track of the number of turns. </br>
Players have to click on the cards to flip them and find all the matching pairs. </br>
If the clicked cards are not the same, they will be flipped back, and the turn counter will be incremented by 1. </br>
</br>
We need to win the game within 15 turns.</br>
Once the game is complete, we can also reset it using the “New Game” button to reshuffle all the cards and set the turn counter back to 0. </br>
